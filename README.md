# Schedule-Maker-Application
This application allows users to create events by scheduling them. The first step I took was creating different models, such as the Event and UserInfo models, and controllers to allow the backend to fetch and store data in the database. After that, I added CSS to structure the website by identifying the HTML elements I wanted to style.
